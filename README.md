**Budget vs Actuals Variance Analysis**

Overview

This project is a Budget vs Actuals Variance Analysis built in Excel. The spreadsheet is fully dynamic, allowing users to modify budget or actuals data and see real-time updates 
in the variance calculations and visualizations. No values are hardcoded, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in the analysis.


Features

* Fully Linked Model: All calculations update automatically when values are changed.

* Variance Analysis: Displays the difference between budgeted and actual figures.

* Dynamic Graphs: Visual representations of variances that adjust dynamically based on input changes.

* Month Selector: Uses data validation for selecting specific months.


Formula Usage:

* SUM() for aggregating data

* SPARKLINES for trend visualization

* IFERROR() for handling potential errors

* INDEX(MATCH()) for flexible data retrieval

* Conditional Formatting to highlight significant variances

* Percentage Variances included as an additional metric


What I Learned

* The importance of dynamic linking in financial models to ensure accuracy and ease of updates.

* How to use INDEX(MATCH()) for retrieving data efficiently instead of relying on VLOOKUP.

* How to implement sparklines to provide a quick visual summary of trends.

* The value of data validation to enhance usability and prevent input errors.

* How to apply conditional formatting to emphasize significant variances.

* The benefit of incorporating percentage variances to add deeper insights into performance analysis.

This project was inspired by a tutorial from YouTube: Budget vs Actuals Variance Analysis.


How to Use

1. Open the Excel file.

2. Modify the budget or actuals data in the respective sections.

3. Use the month selector to filter the analysis.

4. Observe the automatically updated variance calculations and graphs.

5. Identify key trends with conditional formatting and percentage variance calculations.


Future Improvements

* Enhancing the dashboard with more interactive elements.
